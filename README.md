# Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation
MLE of mean and variance

A normally distributed dataset is generated using scipy.stats library 

The generated dataset has zero mean and unit variance.

Likelihood of mean (with variance fixed) is found using the scipy.stats library function pdf(i)

Maximum likelihood estimate(RED) and Original likelihood estimate(BLUE) are marked.
